So in order to do all of this we need to replace the files each time we update them, this can be done from anywhere and
im not sure in you know any of this but the way I had to do the first two copies was after i changed some things i 
made a copy of the new updated code and just threw it into my github folder and replaced the files that were in there

Okay so looking into what i did before don't replace the files that were in the folder, just add them as separate copies 
so we can have the old versions of the code
